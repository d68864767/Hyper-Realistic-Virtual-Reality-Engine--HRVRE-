# System Architecture

The Hyper-Realistic Virtual Reality Engine (HRVRE) is a Node.js-based VR engine designed to create hyper-realistic virtual environments. The system architecture is meticulously crafted to support the complex and multi-faceted nature of the HRVRE project.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of the HRVRE project is as follows:

```

## Key Components

### Configurations

The configurations for the server and the VR engine are stored in `src/config/`. The server configuration (`serverConfig.js`) includes settings for the host, port, environment, log directory, app root, public directory, view directory, session secret, and session max age. The VR engine configuration (`engineConfig.js`) includes settings for the graphics renderer, texture quality, physics engine, gravity, NPC behavior, interactive elements, scene builder, and lighting manager.

### Utilities

The utilities for logging and error handling are stored in `src/utils/`. The logger (`logger.js`) uses the winston library to log error, warn, info, http, and debug messages. The error handler (`errorHandler.js`) is a middleware that logs error details and sets the HTTP status code.

### VR Engine

The core VR engine components are stored in `src/vrEngine/`. This includes modules for graphics rendering, physics simulation, AI-driven components, and virtual environment management.

### API

The API layer for external interfaces is stored in `src/api/`. This includes controllers for API requests, middleware for request processing, API routing, and input validation logic.

### Services

The business logic services are stored in `src/services/`. This includes services related to users and the virtual environment.

### Test Suite

The test suite is stored in `test/`. This includes integration tests and unit tests for modules.

### Public Files

The publicly accessible files are stored in `public/`. This includes CSS stylesheets, client-side JavaScript, and the main HTML file.

### View Templates

The view templates are stored in `views/`. This includes HTML layout templates.

### Documentation

The project documentation is stored in `docs/`. This includes API documentation, a user guide, and a detailed system architecture overview.

### Utility Scripts

The utility scripts for setup and deployment are stored in `scripts/`.

### Node.js Modules

The Node.js modules are stored in `node_modules/`, but this directory is not tracked in version control.

### Environment Variables

The environment variables are stored in `.env`.

### Project Metadata and Dependencies

The project metadata and dependencies are stored in `package.json`.

### Project Overview and Documentation

The project overview and documentation are stored in `README.md`.
