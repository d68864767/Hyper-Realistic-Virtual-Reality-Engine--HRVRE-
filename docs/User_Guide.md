## Configuration

The HRVRE system can be configured by setting environment variables. The following environment variables are available:

### Server Configuration

- `HOST`: The host on which the server runs. Default is `localhost`.
- `PORT`: The port on which the server listens. Default is `3000`.

- `LOG_DIR`: The directory where logs are stored. Default is `log`.
- `APP_ROOT`: The root directory of the application. Default is `src`.
- `PUBLIC_DIR`: The directory for publicly accessible files. Default is `public`.
- `VIEW_DIR`: The directory for view templates. Default is `views`.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: The secret key for session management. Default is `your-secret-key`.

### VR Engine Configuration

- `RENDERER`: The renderer used for graphics. Default is `WebGL`.
- `TEXTURE_QUALITY`: The quality of textures. Default is `high`.
- `PHYSICS_ENGINE`: The physics engine used. Default is `Bullet`.
- `GRAVITY`: The gravity in the virtual environment. Default is `-9.8`.
- `NPC_BEHAVIOR`: The behavior of non-player characters. Default is `advanced`.
- `INTERACTIVE_ELEMENTS`: The interactivity of environment elements. Default is `enabled`.

## Interacting with the Virtual Environment

The HRVRE system provides a hyper-realistic virtual environment that you can interact with. You can move around the environment, interact with non-player characters, and manipulate interactive elements in the environment.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the HRVRE system, please refer to the logs in the `log` directory. If the issue persists, please contact the HRVRE support team.

Thank you for using the Hyper-Realistic Virtual Reality Engine!
